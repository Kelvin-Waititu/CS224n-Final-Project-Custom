### Example 1
Text: This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.
Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.
In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.
We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.
HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:  ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.
Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.
In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.
We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.
Thank you for your cooperation.

### Example 4
Text: Ken,  I feel terrible in writing this email to inform you that I am leaving Enron.
The timing of my departure is purely coincidental to the timing of the recent events.
It has been a special and rewarding privilege to work at Enron over the past three and a half years.
The integrity and high purpose you stand for is a personal inspiration to me.
Seeing your leadership first-hand has been a real treat.
Receiving the Chairman's Award last year was an incredible honor.
It is difficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbers of amazingly dedicated, yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron.
I have the greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them.
One regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use my departure as more negative fodder to taint the company image.
I wouldn't ever wish that on you, especially in light of the recent challenges you are experiencing.
So I apologize if that does come to pass.
One factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abuses I've observed with EES' origination management.
There is a general feeling  of despair because the management chain looks the other way and the concept  of an "open door" is political suicide.
H.R.
is as much at fault in my  opinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objective  view and judgement of the abuses.
My words and credibility may not carry  any weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassination  that is all too common at EES.
Though my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees  (and lost potential benefit to Enron), I leave with no bad feelings toward the company and am proud to have been a part of Enron.
The shift in EES' business model had resulted in my taking on a new role this past spring.
Being based outside of Houston (in the Chicago area), my career opportunities are limited.
And as much as I tried, I was feeling stale and unfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me to move on.
Ken, I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficult  time.
I wish that I could have done more.
If I can ever help, I hope that you won't hesitate to ask.
Thank you again.
Respectfully,

Text: Just a note to check on all our beloveds on this horrible day.
We are glued   to the tv while we carry on our daily activities in Columbia.
Actually I   told John I hope they don't call in the WWII Submariners for active duty or   he is in trouble.
Actually there are very few of them left and I doubt this   war will be fought in the water.
We have had several calls this morning to inquire if we are o.k.
Yes we are   fine, except devastated about what is happening to the Country.
On a routine note, we have painters painting our garage, workers putting on   new siding at our rental house across the street, A furnace man putting in a   new energy efficient furnace also in the rental house.
Most of these workers   are in good spirits..some mostly unaware of what is going on.
The furnace   man thought the answer to our problems was that everybody should carry more   guns.
Life goes on at many different levels.
Stay safe all of you.
Stay off the planes and out of government buildings.

How was your weekend?
When are you suppose to see the lawyer?
I spoke with mine over the phone on Sat.
and will be seeing the other one on this week.
Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of us.
The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there before I was did not get it.
She offered the apartment to me.
I went in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.
I am soo afraid/scared.
I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.
I caught him crying in the basement.
Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive a huge hug.

### Example 2
Text: Jeff-  As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.
Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept.
The purpose of this note is twofold.
First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.
I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.
Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.
I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.
Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.
At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.
I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!).
Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.
Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work!

Text: I just wanted to say thanks for coming by and speaking with the IPG visitors last week, and spending so much time with them.
Your comments combined with the rest of the tour left them  with just the impression we wanted to give them.
They are eager to see if a deal can be struck between our two companies so we will begin finalizing a term sheet as soon as possible.
I would have sent the thank you note earlier, but at the end of the day I took my family on vacation to my parents place.
There I had a chance to run into Bart Robinson one of your former co-workers from the consulting days, and one of my parents good friends.
He says hello.
Thanks again and I still remain impressed how commercial the senior management at Enron is compared to Coastal/Engage where I came from.

Text: my printer just froze, and I want to look at the doc to finish the  reorganization.
Could you pretty please fax me the first 14 pages (I have  the last).
Also, could you look at the stuff I've highlighted in yellow.
I haven't put all your comments in, but I will in a minute.
Don't get  discouraged, the draft is closer to finished than it looks, it is just the  changes are in my head.
It won't take too terribly long now.
I've set up the exhibits as a separate document to make it easier to move  around the doc.
I think it would be kind of strange to send a draft without the most basic of  commercial terms included.
Stranger things have happened of course!
Many thanks.

### Example 5
Text: Dear Mr. Lay,  I went home yesterday along with the other 3,999 employees who lost their jobs at Enron.
Even though we had weeks to prepare for the worst, when the layoffs occurred, it really hit me hard.
I cried a great deal, not only about the uncertainty of my future, but for the loss of relationships and friendships that I had established over the last five years I spent at Enron.
The hardest aspect of yesterday was saying "goodbye" to my friends and co-workers.
We've all made a resolution to stay in touch and hopefully we will all pick up the pieces and carry on with our lives.
I appreciate the efforts that were made to get us some severance, but as you are well aware, gave so much of ourselves to the company and lost so much in return..
I'm sure I'm not alone in encouraging you and Enron management to continue to push for additional severance for those of us who lost our jobs.
This is a hard time to hit the street looking for a job, while Continential, Compaq and now Enron have downsized and the holidays are upon us.
I know you have probably received this kind of message  many times in the last few weeks, but I hope you will continue to do the right thing for the employees.
We need the additional severance to be able to ensure food on the table and roofs over our heads until we can land on our feet after this free fall.
I will never regret my 5 years at Enron.
They are an important part of my past.
I appreciate your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,

Text: Greetings:  Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time,  we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail,  etc.
I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes  of credit check.
Here is some additional information about the project.
If  any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can  forward along to GP for answers.
At this point we have tentatively scheduled  a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F.
office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM  (PDT).
A Little Background: Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of  California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis  Obispo, Monterey, S.F.).
Will use a "festooned" arrangement (i.e., exit sea  at each city point).
Total undersea length is ~900 km.
At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two,  separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
Will deploy DWDM.
Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific  systems.
In addition to "loops" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes  a terrestial leg from S.F.
to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF  and Monterey.
Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F.
to Monterey terrestial  leg).
Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego  to create a complete loop.
Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC  certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from  Coastal Commission.
Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo)  built and lit by end of Q1 2001.
Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with  federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.
May end up bypassing Monterey  altogether.
The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being "clueless"  when it comes to marketing the capacity.
Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in  (per Ethan's emails).
They are distressed.
Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.

### Example 8
Text: Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an "Into Product" is  and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission  and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.
Attendees from  Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last  name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.
If you think somebody  else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I  can talk to Harlan.
Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an  internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet  with Dynegy.
As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively  with a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product  is.
Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against  they way the product ultimately got defined.
Dynegy put on a big dog and  pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that  EEI's Into product was flawed.
Their position, while not completely  expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are  making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be  excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in  general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another  interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when  firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the  receiving control area).
Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they  have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go  physical.
At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in  firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent  product.
Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.
I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:  1.
Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition  - Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.
We  trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common  understanding of what we are trading.
Critical to clear up this ambiguity.
2.
Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against  EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost  acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice  against the Into definition.
3.
Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what  will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is  such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally  we all agree how it should operate.
Additionally, it is critical that we  start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in  transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may  want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes  into an RTO)  Call me with any questions/thoughts.
Thanks
